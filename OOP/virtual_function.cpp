Create a class telephone_directory (name, occupation, phone, address) and an virtual
function search (), that searches the object contents in a linear fashion. Extend the class in a
specific class called doctor (qualification, clinic, visiting time) and override the virtual function
such that it searches using binary search. Also create another class lawyer (qualification,
civil/criminal, cases attended, contact_no, office_address) that extends the telephone_directory
such that it wonâ€™t override the virtual function. Search for a doctor and a lawyer by taking the
option from the user.
