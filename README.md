# CPP-My-journey-of-competitive-programming
During the first semester of my CS Engineering i started off my programming journey with C language which was then followed by C++ and Python. However, after multiple switches between these 3 languages I finally decided to go ahead with C++ to solve the competitive programming problems. This repository is dedicated to the path which I followed with a aim to develop my probelem solving skills.
